# BurgerTranslate
Burger Translate is an experimental framework to build tranlation bot and neural networks on Python and C++. The framework has just started to develop. So there are not many works done yet but they are cool.

This repository provides a library that's distributed by npm that you use for building your own bots. See the documentation for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.
